This extension provides a way to run a shell command after updating a buffer.
So you can have a shell script which makes and runs a C program, and then you would
M-x watch-buffer, enter the shell script to run, and every time you save the file it
will run the shell script asynchronously in a separate buffer.

(watch-command "<command>") and (unwatch-command) can also be called from elisp,
and will operate on the current buffer.  Use `with-current-buffer' to invoke them
on other buffers.
